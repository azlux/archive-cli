KISS extract/compress easy to learn function

### About
Extract/Compress easy to learn function.
I complained against all the CLI commands on linux to compress / decompress files and folders.
So I've write scripts.

- One command to compress :`archive-compress` (only 2 parameters available)

- One command to decompress/extract: `archive-extract`

The script take care of the file extension to call the good command.

### Install
todo : debian package

Currently : git clone
